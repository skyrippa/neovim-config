# Neovim Personal Configs

This repository has the sole purpose of having a remote repository to, whenever I'm changing OS, or devices, I can always 
have the same setup for my Neovim editor.

## Built-in features
I added some built-in features to Neovim, such as enabling line number, indentation length and autoindentation, as well as horizontal scrolling.
<br><br>I also enabled the possibility of overriding the global configuration for the editor, with a local .nvimrc file for each project.
<br><br>Last but not least, I've mapped some shortcuts to navigate between Neovim windows and exiting its terminal emulator.

## Plugins
I've added some plugins, whose improved my productivity while keeping the editor simple and minimalist.

* [Ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) - *To enable file searching.*
* [Vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - *Git wrapper.*
* [Vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - *Lightweight file status/tabline.*
* [Vim-sleuth](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth) - *File indentation on the fly.*
* [Coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) - *Powerful extension host for IDE-like experience (autocomplete, linting, LSP...).*
* [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) - *A tree explorer plugin for vim.*
* [NightFox](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim) - *Highly customizable theme for vim and neovim with support for lsp, treesitter 
and a variety of plugins.*
* [Lucid Theme](https://github.com/cseelus/vim-colors-lucid) - *A color scheme for VIM with vivid highlights and friendly, clear colors.*

## Other confs
I also added a note to remember myself for when I'm setting up Neovim on another OS or machine, to bind `Solargraph` with `Coc.nvim` and have
Ruby docs and autocomplete available for me. This is because nowadays I mainly work with the Ruby language, but I'm sure there are many other options
available.

## Appearance
